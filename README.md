I put together a simple checklist that I personally use directly in OBS via a custom browser dock and have since been asked to share it as others may find it useful during their own livestreams.

There aren't many bells or whistles, very plain and simple; edit the file in *[js/custom.js](js/custom.js)* with your own tasks, save, and then view *[index.html](index.html)* in whatever HTML rendering software you'd like to have access to the interactive checklist. If you wish to change the look and feel of the checklist you can edit the file in css/custom.css as needed.

If using OBS you can embed it as a custom dock as the above image by following these instructions;

- Click on *View*.
- Mouse over *Docks*.
- Click on *Custom Browser Docks...*
- In the menu that appears, give the dock a name and point the URL to the *index.html* page.
  - *To get a local URL, just open the index.html file in your browser and copy the shown URL.*
